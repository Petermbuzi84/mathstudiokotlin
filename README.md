# mathstudiokotlin
MathStudioKotlin has classes and functions that makes mathematical calculations based on formulas, methods and other mathematical algorithms.

use the functions to provide an answer for the following question:

*A minor arc of a circle subtends an angle of 105 degrees at the center of the circle. If the radius of the circle is 8.4 cm, find the length of the major arc.*

The solution to the problem above is 37.4 cm

### Tests
There are test functions that confirms that the math functions are working properly.
If you decide to alter the function to your needs, you can run the tests to ensure that they are working as expected.
